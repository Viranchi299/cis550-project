## Usage

Clone the Github repo to an IDE on your local machine (we used VS Code). Make sure you have React installed on your machine, or you could install the React module by typing this command in the terminal:

npm install --save react

Then, in the project directory:

cd into the /client directory and type **npm install**. This will download all the required client-side dependencies, which are specified in package.json into the node_modules/ directory.

cd out of the /client directory and into the /server directory and type **npm install**. This will download all required server-side dependencies.

While in the server folder, type **npm start** in the terminal to start the server. 

In a separate terminal window, cd into the client folder and type **npm start**. This will start the client-side code. 

If your setup was successful, you should see the landing page below open up on your browser at http://localhost:3000. An example display of the dashboard page is shown below.
