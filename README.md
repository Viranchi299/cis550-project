## Usage

Clone the Github repo to an IDE on your local machine (we used VS Code). Make sure you have React installed on your machine, or you could install the React module by typing this command in the terminal:

npm install --save react

Then, in the project directory:

cd into the /client directory and type:

**npm install**

This will download all the required client-side dependencies, which are specified in package.json into the node_modules/ directory

which would open http://localhost:3000 for you to view the visualizer in the browser.

### Tools used

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Description: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces


### Acknowledgments

We used some starter code from our fellow Penn alum Clément Mihailescu https://github.com/clementmihailescu that included the implementation of MergeSort, which we have since modified to make it visually consistent with the other sorting algorithms we wrote independently.
